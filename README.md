# Todoist Habit Tracker

1. Add a task with `[day 0]` at the end of the content
2. Schedule it `every day`
3. and the magic will occur when you complete it  
Ex: `Enjoy your day [day 0]` -> `Enjoy your day [day 1]` -> `Enjoy your day [day 2]` 

‚ÑπÔ∏è I know my README is not really complete, but I'm not sure anyone will find it in the GitHub blackhole üòÑ, feel free to write me if you need !

## Todoist side 

1. Create an app https://developer.todoist.com/appconsole.html
2. Add a webhook with `item:completed` and your callback url `domain.com/api/webhook/complete-item`
3. Go through oAuth authentification procedure https://developer.todoist.com/sync/v8/#oauth to add an user to your app (Can be done via Postman)  
4. Get the ApiKey from https://todoist.com/prefs/integrations set `TODOIST_TOKEN` in `.env` 

## Env
Replace `.env.dist` to `.env` and fill it with your value

## Deployment

- Build : `cargo build --release` 
- I use the Api via Nginx (reverse proxy) & systemctl (see help ‚¨áÔ∏è)

## Roadmap

- Add a job to reset to 0 when a task was not completed one day (see inspiration) or maybe juste reset to 1 if I check the scheduling date of the task
